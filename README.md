## Project WildFire
- This is a project based on relating average temperature per state data and number of factories using combustion energy data to the number of wildfires in certain areas
- It will represented by a map of the usa and a pie chart
- For the USA Map, each state will show:
  * the number of wildfires during the selected month and year in each state
  * the average temperature in all states during the selected month and year
  * the number of factories using combustion energy during the selected month and year in each state
- For the Pie chart
